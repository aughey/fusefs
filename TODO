TODO for FuseFS
===============

- Iron out design and API. I both like and don't like what I have now: A lot of
  code duplication happens because of can_write?, can_delete?, can_rmdir? and
  can_mkdir? ... Can anyone think of a better method?

- Option to include "allow_other" as a fuse mount options. I did this by
  default at first. oops.

- Consider FIFOs? We can use FIFOs to mimic TCP internet, if we do this right.
