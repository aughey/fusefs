TODO for FuseFS
===============

- Iron out design and API. I both like and don't like what I have now: A lot of
  code duplication happens because of can_write?, can_delete?, can_rmdir? and
  can_mkdir? ... Can anyone think of a better method?

- Include support for not passing any editor files to the FS. That is: don't
  pass vim .foo.swp files to FuseRoot, but handle it ourselves. Ditto for emacs
  and any other editors.

- More SampleFS's?

- touch <filename> replaces file with empty string. Find out why, and fix.

- "touch" gets "not implemented" errors because we don't care about
  utime/atime/etc. Implement a stub to just throw away changes.

- Option to include "allow_other" as a fuse mount options. I did this by
  default at first. oops.

- ???
